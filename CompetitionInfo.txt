Java solution written for the University of South Carolina Big Data Health Science case competition Feb 7-8th, 2020. My team were the only undergraduate finalists based on the performance of this solution, and the case we built and presented around it. Teams of Undergraduate and Graduate students were given CSV files containing 1010000 simulated patient records and the symptoms associated with 311 chemicals, and were asked to match each patient to a chemical based on their reported symptoms. The solution produced matches with 63% accuracy.
